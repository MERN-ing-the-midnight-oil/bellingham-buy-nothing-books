to give other users admin privileges

Logging and Monitoring:
Implement logging for join requests and monitor for unusual activity, like a single user trying to join numerous communities in a short period.

/routes
/books - index.js (Handles all book-related routes including add, delete-offer, my-library, borrow, return, request, booksFromMyCommunities, offeredInCommunity, and unavailable)
/games - index.js (Handles all game-related operations like search, lend, remove-game, my-library-games, request, my-requested-games, gamesFromMyCommunities)
/communities - index.js (Includes routes for create, list, join, leave, user-communities)
/users - index.js (Contains routes for user registration, login, me, and potentially other user profile or management operations not directly related to books or games)
