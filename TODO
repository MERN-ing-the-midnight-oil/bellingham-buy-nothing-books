Rename "Community" and "gettogether" as "coffee hour" or , possibly, "meetup", or "club"
Impliment a Chat / microphone combo for listing your games and books that will let the user just talk about the books they own and will generate their library.

Community Joining Functionality:
Users can join a community by entering a 4 digit code
Implement rate-limiting on the community join endpoint to prevent abuse.

Admin Functionality to Remove Users:
Implement a feature where community admins can remove users from their community. This could be a simple option in the community management interface.

Logging and Monitoring:
Implement logging for join requests and monitor for unusual activity, like a single user trying to join numerous communities in a short period.

Future Feature - Invitation Links:
Plan for a future feature where users can invite others to a community via a shareable link. This feature would further streamline the process of joining a community. Give all users the ability to share the link , maybe via a QR code.

Adding Games.
Parse the CSV File: You'll need to parse the CSV file to convert it into a format that can be used to populate your database. Node.js has several libraries for parsing CSV files, such as csv-parser or papaparse.

Populate the Database: Once you've parsed the CSV data, you can use it to populate your MongoDB database with game data. This could be done as a one-time script if the data doesn't change frequently, or as part of your application logic if the data needs regular updates.

API Endpoints: You'll need to create API endpoints to interact with the game data. This might include endpoints to list games, add a game to a user's library, search for games, etc.

Front-End Integration: Finally, integrate this functionality into your front end, allowing users to view, search, and add games to their personal library.
