Create Get-Together

Rename "Community" and "gettogether" as social group.

Community Joining Functionality:
Users can join a community by entering a 4 digit code
Implement rate-limiting on the community join endpoint to prevent abuse.

Admin Functionality to Remove Users:
Implement a feature where community admins can remove users from their community. This could be a simple option in the community management interface.

Logging and Monitoring:
Implement logging for join requests and monitor for unusual activity, like a single user trying to join numerous communities in a short period.

Future Feature - Invitation Links:
Plan for a future feature where users can invite others to a community via a shareable link. This feature would further streamline the process of joining a community. Give all users the ability to share the link , maybe via a QR code.
